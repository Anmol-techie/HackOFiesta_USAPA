## Abstract:

Agriculture is the most essential domain for our country with 58% population relying on it as a source of livelihood. The main motive of our project is to help with the uncertainty in the agriculture domain and assist the farmers in structured crop planning as well as aid the government with budget planning.

### There is a trend of increase in the price of agricultural products due to

- Failure of monsoon or late arrival of monsoon and decline in sown area of that year
- Lack of unified Prediction and Forecasting System
- Lack of analysis on integrated data such as Meteorological data of forecast, yield/production data across states, Inventory and Public Distribution, Wholesale and Retail agricultural commodity process etc.

### These issues can be solved using

District wise prediction of yield per crop, based on previous crop yield as well as predicted meteorological weather.

- Finding trends between production and rates for different crops.
- Finding how budget allocation affects the yield and rates of the crops in that year.
- Using these trends to provide suggestions/insights to budget allotment for various Yojanas by the Government.

## Domain:

Artificial Intelligence, Web development

## Features:

Crop Yield Prediction Visualization, National level analysis of crop data showing all states, State and district level crop data showing area wise yield, Providing integrated data as input for Budget planning & monetary allocation to Agriculture at federal and state level, Display of import-export of commodities on a national level.

## Tech Stack:

Python, MongoDB, Pandas, Numpy, ReactJS, Express, E-Charts, GitHub
